# Portraits here are one you can choose from in the character creater. For prescripted races they are grabbed straight from the .gfx file. 
# playable=(yes/no)/trigger, default is yes, if this species class can is playable

# custom_portraits
#	randomized = trigger, default is no, to specify if portraits are randomized
#	playable = trigger, default is yes, to specify if portraits are playable
#	portraits, list portrait keys
# species_trait_points: base number of species trait points available for this species class
# species_max_traits: maximum number of traits that species of this class can have (doesn't count those with cost == 0)
# possible: ethics/government requirements; see common/governments/readme_requirements.txt
# gender: yes|no (default: yes). whether the species have a gender
