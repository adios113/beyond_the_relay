  EMPIRE_DESIGN_SystemsAlliance_desc:0 "The Systems Alliance is the representative body of Earth and all human colonies in Citadel space. Backed by Earth's most powerful nations, the Alliance has become humanity's military, exploratory, and economic spearhead. While the Alliance is relatively new to the galactic community, it has already made a name for itself, gaining humans an embassy on the Presidium. The Alliance is governed by a parliament based at Arcturus Station, which also serves as the Alliance's capital."
  EMPIRE_DESIGN_AsariRepublics:0 "Asari Republics"
  EMPIRE_DESIGN_AsariRepublics_desc:0 "The asari, native to the planet Thessia, are often considered the most influential and respected sentient species in the galaxy, and are known for their elegance, diplomacy, and biotic aptitude. This is partly due to the fact that the asari were among the earliest races to achieve interstellar flight after the Protheans, and the first to discover and settle the Citadel."
  EMPIRE_DESIGN_ElcorEmpire:0 "Courts of Dekuuna"
  EMPIRE_DESIGN_ElcorEmpire_desc:0 "The elcor are a Citadel species native to the high-gravity world Dekuuna. They are massive creatures, standing on four muscular legs for increased stability. Elcor move slowly, an evolved response to an environment where a fall can be lethal. This has colored their psychology, making them deliberate and conservative."
  EMPIRE_DESIGN_TurianHierarchy:0 "Turian Hierarchy"
  EMPIRE_DESIGN_TurianHierarchy_desc:0 "Known for their militaristic and disciplined culture, the turians were the third race to join the Citadel Council. They gained their Council seat after defeating the hostile krogan for the Council during the Krogan Rebellions. The turians deployed a salarian-created biological weapon called the genophage, which virtually sterilised the krogan and sent them into a decline. The turians then filled the peacekeeping niche left by the once-cooperative krogan, and eventually gained a Council seat in recognition of their efforts."
  EMPIRE_DESIGN_SalarianUnion:0 "Salarian Union"
  EMPIRE_DESIGN_SalarianUnion_desc:0 "The second species to join the Citadel, the salarians are warm-blooded amphibians native to the planet Sur'Kesh. Salarians possess a hyperactive metabolism; they think fast, talk fast, and move fast. To salarians, other species seem sluggish and dull-witted, especially the elcor. Unfortunately, their metabolic speed leaves them with a relatively short lifespan; salarians over the age of 40 are a rarity."
  EMPIRE_DESIGN_BatarianHegemony:0 "Salarian Union"
  EMPIRE_DESIGN_BatarianHegemony_desc:0 "A race of four-eyed bipeds native to the world of Khar'shan, the batarians are a disreputable species that chose to isolate itself from the rest of the galaxy. The Terminus Systems are infested with batarian pirate gangs and slaving rings, fueling the stereotype of the batarian thug. It should be noted that these criminals do not represent average citizens, who are forbidden to leave batarian space by their ubiquitous and paranoid government."
  EMPIRE_DESIGN_GethConsensus:0 "GethConsensus"
  EMPIRE_DESIGN_GethConsensus_desc:0 "The geth (\"Servant of the People\" in Khelish) are a race of networked artificial intelligences that reside beyond the Perseus Veil. The geth were created by the quarians as laborers and tools of war. When the geth became sentient and began to question their masters, the quarians attempted to exterminate them. The geth won the resulting war, and reduced the quarians to a race of nomads."
